The LeNet architecture is an excellent "first architecture" for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),proposed by Yan LeCun, León Bottou, Yoshua Bengio and Patrick Haffner in 1998. It has 5 layers, the input has to be 32x32 size. The operations in each layer are:
1. Convolution,relu and pooling
2. Convolution,relu and pooling
3. Classification (fully conected)
4. Classification (fully conected)
5. Classification (fully conected)

The output has the number of labels size
