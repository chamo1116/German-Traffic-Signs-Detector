The logistic regression is a predictive analysis is use for clasification because explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one more nominal,ordinal, interval, or ratio-level independent variables that determine an outcome. the outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes). It's used to predict a binary outcome (1/0, Yes/No, True, False) given a set of independent variables. In simple words, it predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logit function.
